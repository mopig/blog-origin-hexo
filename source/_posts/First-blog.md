## Additional Features
Bear and most of its core features are free to use on iPad, iPhone, and Mac. We want everyone to be able to write beautifully and organize notes with our unique tools.

If you want to unlock some extra features and beautiful themes, and support Bearâ€™s future development, you can subscribe in-app to [Bear Pro](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro).  Subscribing to Bear Pro unlocks:

* *Sync* all your notes between Bear for iPad, iPhone, and Mac. Powered by CloudKit. Learn more about Bear's sync and autosave in [[Organize and publish]]. 
* *Export* your notes to a variety of formats for publishing and sharing elsewhere.
* *Beautiful Themes* - eight at launch, and more to come, to give you just the right, comfortable environment for your creativity to flourish.

There are free trials for Bear Pro, too. The monthly subscription gives you one free week to try it out. The yearly subscription gives you a free month. Check out [Bear Pro](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro) in the in-app settings on iPad, iPhone, or Mac.
